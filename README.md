#### Brief Description of Project - This project is done as a project in the second year the second semester under the Information Technology Project (ITP) module. For this module project, we designed an Inventory Control System for Casanova. Casanova is an apparel manufacturing company. Currently, Casanova is facing many problems regarding every process which done inside the company. The main reason for those problems is not having a proper Inventory Control System to manage all their procedures inside the company. By considering all those problems and difficulties they faced the proposed system for Casanova was building up an Inventory Control system. This system contains eight main functionalities. All those eight functions are prepared according to the customerâ€™s needs. They are Order Management, Raw Material Stock Management, Import Management, Account Management, Ready-made Stock Management, Production Management, Quality Check Management and Transport Management. A complete system along with those eight functions and including login and home pages was developed under this IT project. It can be concluded that this Inventory Control System can be effectively used to increase the work process and operate every function efficiently, easily and reliably.

#### Technologies used - React.js,Node.js,Express.js, MongoDB Atlas (MERN Stack)
